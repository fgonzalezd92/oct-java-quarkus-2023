### Implement cache in lab09 movies API

* Apply cache and redesign the endpoints in such a way that a movie is fetched from OMDB only once
* Add a scheduler **(Refer to: https://github.com/prabhu-sunderaraman/oct-java-quarkus-2023/blob/main/quarkus-kafka-applications/lab06-calculator-app)** that cleans up the cache every 5 minutes
